# Demo Application for Kubernetes Security exploitation

This demo application and its accompanying Helm charts are intentionally vulnerabl!  They are designed to provide an environment for testing and demonstrating ways how to exploit Kubernetes workloads.

---

## ⚠️ Warning

- **Do NOT run this demo in production or any critical clusters.**  
- It is strongly recommended to run this demo **only locally** on isolated environments such as Minikube, Kind, or a local Kubernetes cluster.  
- **Do NOT expose this demo to the public internet.**  
- I do NOT take responsibility for any damage, data loss, or security incidents caused by running this vulnerable demo.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a playground for testing security scanning, policy enforcement, runtime detection, and other Kubernetes security tooling.  
- Help understand common vulnerabilities and how security tools can detect or mitigate them.

## Getting Started

More detailed instructions and updates will be added soon.
